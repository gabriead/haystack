Design Decisions and Tradeoffs
-> Reusing existing codebase from request (put link here)
-> The code already provides a run method that accepts a list<Documents> and outputs a list<Documents> including the
metadata that includes the detected entities and their locations within a sentence

Limitations and proposed solution
-> limitations NER model: training data is very old (2003) => a lot of entities will not be detected correctly
-> 

Possible future enhancements of your solution
-> use different NER model
